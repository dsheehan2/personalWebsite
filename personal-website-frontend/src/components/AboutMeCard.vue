      <p class="info">
        Hello I am Dylan! I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and am
        currently pursuing my master's degree while working in the Department of
        Defense (DoD). As a software developer, I have a strong focus on
        front-end technologies, particularly with frameworks like Vue and
        Angular. On the back end, I’m proficient in Java and Spring, and I often
        work with databases such as Accumulo and Hadoop, utilizing MapReduce for
        data processing. Coding is not just my job; it’s a passion that I love
        to explore in my free time, especially as I delve into the fascinating
        world of cybersecurity.

        When I’m not coding, you can find me enjoying outdoor activities like
        golf, fishing, and playing soccer. These hobbies help me unwind and keep
        things light. I think it's important to have fun while working hard, and
        I strive to maintain a good balance between my professional and personal
        life to keep my creativity flowing.
